    "# Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a Python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we’re explore in this lesson: numeric and text data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A floating point (known as a float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For example: 1.13, 2.0, 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer will never have a decimal point. Thus if we wanted to store 1.13 as an integer it would be stored as 1. Similarly, 1234.345 would be stored as 1234. You will often see the data type Int64 in Python which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can store in each “cell”. Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data type is known as Strings in Python, or Objects in Pandas. Strings can contain numbers and / or characters. For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. A Pandas object might also be a plot name like ‘plot1’. A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, ‘1234’ could be stored as a string. As could ‘10.23’. However strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas and base Python use slightly different names for data types. More on this is in the table below:\n"

    "## Missing Data Values - NaN\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened in the last challenge activity? Notice that this throws a value error: ValueError: Cannot convert NA to integer. If we look at the weight column in the surveys data we notice that there are NaN (Not a Number) values. NaN values are undefined values that cannot be represented mathematically. Pandas, for example, will read an empty cell in a CSV or Excel sheet as a NaN. NaNs have some desirable properties: if we were to average the weight column without replacing our NaNs, Python would know to skip over those cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with missing data values is always a challenge. It’s sometimes hard to know why values are missing - was it because of a data entry error? Or data that someone was unable to collect? Should the value be 0? We need to know how missing values are represented in the dataset in order to make good decisions. If we’re lucky, we have some metadata that will tell us more about how null values were handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in some disciplines, like Remote Sensing, missing data values are often defined as -9999. Having a bunch of -9999 values in your data could really alter numeric calculations. Often in spreadsheets, cells are left empty where no data are available. Pandas will, by default, replace those missing values with NaN. However it is good practice to get in the habit of intentionally marking cells that have no data, with a no data value! That way there are no questions in the future when you (or someone else) explores your data.\n",

    "## Where are the NaN's\n",
